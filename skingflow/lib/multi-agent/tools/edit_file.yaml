name: edit_file
description: |
  Tool for editing files in the virtual filesystem by replacing specific text content.
  
  This performs exact string replacement, similar to find-and-replace functionality.
  Use this when you need to make targeted changes to existing files without rewriting the entire content.
  
  Important notes:
  - The old_string must match exactly (including whitespace and formatting)
  - If old_string appears multiple times, only the first occurrence will be replaced
  - For multiple replacements, call this tool multiple times
  - The file must exist before editing
